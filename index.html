    >> GUI stands for graphical user interface. It is a user interface which user interact with applications by making use of graphics. In GUI more than one task can run simultaneously. The user interacts by pointing the applications using devices like mouse. It is a very user friendly interface.
    Example(Windows, Linux)

    <p><font face="lato" size = "5"> CUI </font></p>

    >> CUI stands for character user interface.

    In CUI user has to interact with the applications by making use of commands.
    
    In CUI only one task can run at a time.
